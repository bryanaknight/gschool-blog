End of week 11, and heading into Thankgiving break, we have just finished our first rails app and started into Javascript, a whole new programming language that we will be studying in addition to Ruby and Rails until graduation. 

####First Rails App 
Dinner Dash was the name of the most recent project that we completed and demo-ed last week. The concept was to create an online ordering system for a restaurant, complete with a menu, checkout, user profile and order history and an admin dashboard for the "restaurant owner" to be able to edit the menu. I worked with two other classmates and we were one of just two groups in the class that didn't have a member with prior Rails experience. Needless to say when we were first presented the project, I was intimidated and nervous about the coming two weeks and what we'd be able to accomplish, but I am thrilled with our final project. Not having someone on the team who just knew right away what to do was actually a great thing looking back on it. I learned so much because we as a group had to do the research(i.e. read the documentation), try different approaches, see what worked, and actually execute all on our own for the first time.

#####Highlights:
* Using before actions/filters to secure admin pages of the website. 
* Using Omniauth successfully to login users through Twitter.

#####Lowlights:
* Routes. We finished with 17 controllers and a very large routes file. I think instead of having a separate route for many pages, we should have just appended onto existing routes. It would've made sense for the user and kept our file smaller. 

Overall, I couldn't be happier with the work we put into the project and how much I learned. Since we were all Rails novices, we took the approaching of mobbing, or programming together as a group with one person as the driver, pretty much the entire time, and in this case it worked out really well.

####Javascript 
Javascript is what we've been focusing on this week. Some exercises we've done are: writing exercisms we've done in Ruby already in Javascript, adding Javascript and JQuery *sparkle* to small Rails and Sinatra apps based off the ['Bob' code](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/bob). My first impression is that pure Javascript is not too difficult so far coming from Ruby. They share a lot of basic structure and capability in terms of objects and methods. The JQuery material was confusing at first in just understanding the context to use it. However, one of the classmates gave a lightning talk today on JQuery and now it's becoming more clear!
