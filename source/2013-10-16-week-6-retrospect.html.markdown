####Don't be afraid.

A huge part of being a good programmer is confidence. Being afraid to experiment, break stuff, or go down the wrong path can be a huge hinderence. The more you own the code, the more productive you are, and your end result will be better.

####Ask for help... sometimes.

Coding, to put it lightly, can be frustrating. A lot of the time when you run into an error or get stuck your first instinct is to immediately go ask for help.

Don't, right away.

I've slowly realized that programming is not something you can learn by watching. Learning is doing. Even though it can be maddening, sitting down and struggling through something until you get it is how you learn and retain. However, spending two hours on an error message is typically not time well spent. So, try it out yourself, exhaust the potential fixes you have at your own disposal *(google is your friend)*, and then go ask someone smarter than you.

####Pomodoro breaks are not something you should ignore.

Stepping away from the code for a few minutes helps productivity in the long run. Although it might seem like you're not getting a lot done when you take a break every 25 minutes, so many times i've been stuck, walked away because a little tomato timer told me I had to, and then came back and had an "A-HA" moment.
