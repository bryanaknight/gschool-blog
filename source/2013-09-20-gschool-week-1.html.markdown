This week's project: EventReporter

#Intro:
This week we had to complete a project called [Event Reporter](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html). We wrote a program that loaded a csv file with rows of information on attendees of an event (including first name, last name, address and phone number) and then based on commands from a user, organized and stored that information in a queue. The program was also able to output the organized attendee data into a file named by the user. Pretty cool!

#Work Pattern:
I worked on this project with a classmate, Billy Griffin.  Working with someone on more-or-less the same level as myself was hugely helpful. We worked at a moderate pace, but most importantly, we understood all the code we were writing. If for some reason we needed to seek out help from an instructor or another classmate and didn't fully understand the direction at first, we took the time to talk over the code we just put down, and understand it. Also, another great benefit of working with someone else is that when you're out of ideas, the other person comes through. That helped keep us moving and avoid mental blocks.

#Results:

#Take-aways:
We wrote the program using one class, meaning that the interactive-user portion is looped in with the data-execution portion of the program. Basically, our final result works and has some good chunks of code, but it *should* be structured differently and broken out into several classes i.e. the user command portion should be it's own class, the data-manipulation portion should be it's own class, and we should have a third class that brings the two together to run the program. Big reason we didn't end up writing the code this way is that we didn't first write tests and then write the code. And we found afterwards that it's pretty much impossible to post-test our program. Lesson learned. And now I know what i'll be doing most of the weekend!
