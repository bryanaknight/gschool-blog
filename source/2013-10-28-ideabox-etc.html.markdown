####Week 7 down

This week we completed our first web application, Ideabox. This project was pseudo-independent. We worked individually but were provided a "support group" of four other classmates to go to with questions, pair program if we wanted, collaborate, or if we needed a shoulder to cry on. I enjoyed working independently and I enjoyed working with other classmates, as well. A lot of the time I found myself finding someone who was working on the same extension as me, so at that point it was nice to get together and knock out that feature. 

For this project we used Sinatra. I thought Sinatra was pretty easy to work in. At least by the end I really understood the relationship between the pure Ruby files which were like the brains of the application, the controller file which held all the http requests, and the view files which controlled output and appearance of the actual site. 

If I could go back and start the project from scratch, I would be more strict with the tests. Specifically the acceptance test. I had 100% test coverage for my unit tests, but the acceptance tests we're not as thorough since I wasn't really sure how to write them and test Sinatra when we began the project. Towards the end of the project some of the extensions I had completed started breaking and it was time-consuming to figure out what exactly the problem was since my test coverage wasn't 100%. 

Overall, I feel good about my first web app. I had a lot of fun with the design and CSS as you can see by the Halloween theme. I am pretty proud of that since I didn't know anything about html or CSS two weeks ago, and I didn't bootstrap this. You can check it out here:

####First Code Retreat

On Friday we had our first code retreat. We went to a space called [The Source](https://www.facebook.com/thesourcedenver). We worked in 45 minute time blocks, switching pairs each block, solving a problem with TDD. Each block we were given a different constraint, for example, no if statements or no repetition. 

The Code Retreat was really fun. It was nice to get out of the classroom, work with different people I hadn't gotten the chance to work with before, and complete one small exercise. It felt good to get the small wins and refactor constanty, insteading of working on a massive project.
