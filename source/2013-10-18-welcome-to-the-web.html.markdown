####Project: Ideabox####
This week we dove into web applications. It's been challenging trying to understand the path between Ruby code, the server file, and the view file that determines how the app will appear.  When assigned the project I spend the first day day racing through the tutorial, trying to finish it in order to be able to say I had a functioning product and to get to the extensions. When I was finished, I found myself lost, not really knowing what I had just done or how any of the code really *worked.* The next day I came in and read through the tutorial again, referencing the code I had written and piecing together what each method, erb file and https call does. If I could do it over again, I'd go much slower through the initial tutorial. But thankfully, working with the extensions has forced me to understand more how it all works and implement my own code that wasn't given to me in the tutorial.

####just Ruby vs. Ruby in action####
The first day or two working with a web app was scary, stressful and overwhelming, but when I think back to the beginning of gSchool, that's exactly how I felt the first week and during the first project EventManager. Working with Ruby initially made me feel the exact same way I felt earlier this week and still feel to some degree, but I have the confidence i'll have that "ohhh, I get it!" moment in the next few weeks. My confidence in that spurs from the fact that writing the Ruby in this web app is now the "easy part." 

One practice that has suffered this week is TDD (Test Driven Development). All my ruby files have tests, but that's only two of about ten. We've had a few demos on how to *kind-of*  test the file that connects the code to the output file, but I have only about two or three successful tests for that, which is not enough. My goal for this next week is to tackle that challenge. 

####Report Cards!####
Next week we'll have our first assessments. I think my strong suit will be being able to work through the problem in a creative way. So far i've received feedback from peers that the way I think to solve small problems initially isn't normally what others come up with. So hopefully I can have a moment like that and use a method or approach that isn't as common for the particular problem we are given. I think my biggest weakness is working though errors and breaking through when I get stuck. That's when I depend a lot on my peers, which during the assessment won't really be an option. 

####Appreciation####
In true gSchool fashion, i'd like to give a shoutout to my mentor, **Andy Glass**! Andy is an amazing developer at LivingSocial and a graduate of Hungry Academy (the original gSchool 0). We've had two pair programming sessions since he was assigned my mentor. I think Andy could get excited about just about anything, but his enthusiasm motivates me. I already know he will teach me so much in the next 4 and a half months.
