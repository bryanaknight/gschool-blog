####56 days from now gSchool will be over, and I will transition into a job as a professional programmer. 

On the first day of the course, Jeff warned us that the last month or so was dangerous in that students have to leave often for job interviews and the offers start rolling in. They develop a 'senioritis' of sorts. I feel pretty comfortable in my ability at this point and i'm excited to turn some of my attention to the job search, but I also have a long checklist of things I want to accomplish before the end of gSchool. The more I learned in the past 16 weeks, the more I discovered how much more there is to try and master.  To give you an idea: get better at Javascript, learn vim as well as I know Sublime, experiment in golang, successfully integrate API's into my apps, improve my UI/UX and design skills, and just get better at Ruby/Rails in general. There is always something new to learn or improve at, which is why I got into this field in the first place. 

In order to acheive my best outcomes I need to time manage and focus. I think the key to that will be time-blocking. Half hour a day on exercism, several hours on project work, an hour or so on reading and and 30-60 minutes on job searching. The key to that is the *per day* part. Progress happens over time, not during a cram session. This is something I know but I often fail to take my own advice.

**Things i'm looking forward to:** understanding and implementing an API, independently working on the mastery project and finishing an app I am passionate about, meeting with companies and getting to know the prospects out there. 

**Things I am not looking forward to:** saying goodbye to 27 incredible people.
