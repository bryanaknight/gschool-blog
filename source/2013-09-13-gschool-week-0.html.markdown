Day 1 of gSchool consisted of us 25 students, plus two instructors, Jeff and Katrina, spending the day getting to know each other through [Improv](www.improv.com).  We worked through various exercises such as: small groups coming up with as many unique things all members had in common, telling another's childhood injury story in an animated way as if it were theirs, and story creation based on the combination of seemingly random individual words and phrases. After each exercise we reflected on the lessons we learned and the implications of that lesson in the workplace and in life.  After the day, I knew the 24 students much better (injury horror stories and all) and felt much more comfortable in the space that i'll be spending the majoriy of my time for the next 23 weeks. 

The remainder of the week included four programming tutorials: [Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html),  [Event Manager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html), [Encryptor](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/encryptor.html) and [MicroBlogger](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html). Jeff also spoke about several topics during a few of the morning sessions. Subjects included format of the class and general expectations along with a lecture on Open Source, specifically what it is, licensing and what it means in the Ruby community.

To conclude, i'll leave with some highlights and lowlights (in true retrospect fashion).

**Highlight:** Hearing from hungry academy and gSchool graduates who are now working as programmers at start ups and larger companies (including LivingSocial) around the U.S.  They offered valuable tips to help us not only survive, but get the most out of the next six months.  Many of them also talked about the hard work and difficulty in the curriculum, but ultimately it all came around to a positive in that graduates come out of the program more prepared than most people coming into this field. *Who needs sleep, anyway?*

**Lowlight:** First time around doing Ruby in 100 minutes. It took me way longer than 100 minutes.
