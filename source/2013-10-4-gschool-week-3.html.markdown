Week 4 is coming to a close.  I remember when I first arrived in Denver, before gSchool ever started, saying to a friend, "I can't wait until i'm a month in and I know what the hell i'm doing." 

So the question is, do I know what the hell I'm doing? The answer: somewhat. I don't mean that i'm a good, or even adequate programmer yet, but I can come up with some hack-y code that makes something I want "work" about 80% of the time, I know my way around a terminal and i've successfully used Git to work on a pair project.

During the past two weeks we worked on a project called SalesEngine. We had to take multiple CSV files with merchant, customer, invoice, transaction, invoice item and item data and write a program that parses the information and spits out information one would only know by figuring out how the data files are connected. For example: favorite customer based on items sold, merchant's revenue on a specific date, most popular item based on number sold, etc. If you know excel, think in terms of V-Lookups. Tons and tons of V-Lookups, which like this code, can be very confusing and painful. 

I partnered with a classmate, Adam, and we spent the first week working with a few other classmates on the basic setup of the various classes to deal with the CSV. The second week was more Adam and I working individually and also pair programming to build relationships between the classes and extract the right information we wanted. 

####Lowlight: Monday night at around 9pm. I had been working all day but kept forcing the issue and continued to work. Nothing I produced at that point was pretty or functional. I realized this on Tuesday when I came into school in a better mood, scrapped everything I wrote in the final hour of the previous night, and wrote something 10x better in about 30 minutes. 

####Highlight: Tuesday. The day before the project was due I don't think Adam and I asked for help once. During the first week, the skeleton of what all the classes should look like was passed around the class, so it was almost a group effort to get the basic structure done. Monday consisted of a lot of hand-holding from instructors and the 'smart kids' in the class (who I so greatly look up to and appreciate). Tuesday came down to critical thinking, and it paid off. It was a great confident boost seeing myself break down a problem and work to find an answer, not just asking for help on the first hurdle. 

####Take-aways: Working with a partner can sometimes be challenging. Our instructors informed us that this project made some members of the previous class punch each other...
