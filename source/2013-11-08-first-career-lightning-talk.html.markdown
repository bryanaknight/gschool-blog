Today is the final day in week 9, and I just gave my first lightning talk. For those of you unfamiliar, a lightning talk is a 5 minute talk given at a conference, or in this case in class, about a topic in the ruby (or whatever programming langauge) community. Topics can be technical, but don't necessarily need to be. To give you an idea, other students today talked about: Mustache, Coffescript, ActiveRecord, Factory Girl and Git bits. I spoke about RSpec. But one could give a non-technical talk about, for example, encouraging diversity in the Ruby community, mentorship of young Ruby developers, etc. 

Preparing the talk was sequential. Last Friday we all chose a broad topic related to Rails since we started our first Ruby on Rails project this week. Over the weekend we brainstormed about the topic, Monday talked our ideas over with our teacher Jeff and got his feedback, Tuesday came in with an outline, Wednesday walked through a very rough sequence of talking points and slides, and Thursday was 'dress rehearsal.'

They way we planned the talk made sense. Do a little each day to put the talk together and improve the content and presentation. However, I would say the most work was put into the talks the night before, as we all came in Friday with much improved versions of what we had presented Thursday afternoon to each other. 

My talk was about RSpec, specifically it's history, the motivation behind it and it's intention, it's advantages over minitest and test/unit and it's syntax. 

Although in my presentation I was an advocate for RSpec, my true opinions are not as strong as I portrayed them to be. Simply put, if I were a developer inheriting a code base or reading another's code, I would hope the tests were written in RSpec, since it's much easier to read and understand from an outsider's perspective. However, writing a test, at this point I prefer minitest, which is more more concise and does a fine job of driving development, without the added syntactical complexity in writing the test.
